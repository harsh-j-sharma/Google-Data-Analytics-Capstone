Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study

In this study, we seek to understand the behavioral differences between two user segments of Cyclistic Bike-Share: casual riders and annual members. Our objective is to delve into Cyclistic's historical bike trip data, analyzing usage patterns, preferences, and behaviors of these two distinct groups. We leverage data science techniques including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to reveal patterns and insights.

The impetus behind our research is the strategic business goal of Cyclistic - to maximize the number of annual memberships. As annual members have been identified as more profitable to Cyclistic, converting casual riders into annual members could significantly enhance the company's profitability. Our Director of Marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that a well-crafted marketing campaign targeting casual riders could be a key driver for this conversion.

Our study will help inform this marketing campaign, providing data-driven insights to tailor strategies that resonate with casual riders, addressing their needs and preferences, and, ultimately, encouraging them to become annual members. We believe that understanding these riders' behavior could be instrumental in crafting effective marketing messages and tactics.

We look forward to uncovering these insights and sharing our findings with the broader team at Cyclistic. Our hope is that our work will play a vital role in shaping Cyclistic's future marketing strategies and contribute to its mission of inclusive, accessible, and profitable bike-sharing.
